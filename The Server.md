# The Server

The team built a server to be the brain of the solution. It includes not only the Home Automation application - we used OpenHAB as it is open source and have a hugh number supported systems - but also the database (InfluxDB), reporting (Cacti and Graffano), monitoring (Nagios) tools, firewall (IPTables) and transportation protocol (MQTT).
