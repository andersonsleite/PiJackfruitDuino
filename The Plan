The Plan

The plan behinf this project is to create an easy, inexpensive and reliable smart home ecosystem. 

To do that you will need to prepare your home network, install a server what will be the brain of 
your home and build your own sensors or integrate with the existing sensors in the market.

This project will be split in modules and every single part will allow you to build an important 
block of this smart home ecosystem.

Our team user case will be the core for this project but it can be easily modified to adjust to 
different scenarios.

All the codes will be written in a way that it can be easily modified to your needs. 

We will also try to reuse as much as possible the great knowledge from other people to simplify 
and optimise the project. 

Proper credits will be provided.
